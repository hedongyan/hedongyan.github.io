<h1>Research Interest</h1>
<p>My research interest is causality, agent, evaluation.</p>
<p>Thanks for following me!</p>

<h1>Open Repositories</h1>
<p>
I developed an open-source repositories (https://github.com/hedongyan/awesome-causality-identification) for causal identification, welcome to contribute if you are insteresed in it.
</p>

<h1>Patent</h1>
<p>
  I own a Chinese patent about causal evaluation (用于个性化决策系统的因果模型离线评估和学习方法及其实例). If you are interested in it and want to have a business collaboration, please contact me.
</p>

<h1>Who am I and What I want to do</h1>
<p>I am Hedong YAN from Shandong, China. 
  My Y-chromosome is O-F46(8025 BC)/O-Z26248(2995 BC)/O-MF186197(2975 BC)/O-MF567393(1035 BC), 
  which may be the paternal 600 years' cousin (common paternal node is O-Z26248, 2995 BC) of God Yao (O-Z26258, 2345 BC) at Shanxi 
  and may be in the tribe of God Shaohao (O-F23272, 2765 BC) at Shandong. 
  My mtDNA is A6, which may be the original spouse of Y-chromosome Q. 
  I have 3.79% gene of Homo neanderthalensis. Also, I have a relative higher risk of Parkinson. 
  My dream is to reproduce my chromosome as much as I can, especially the Y-chromosome. 
  So, I want to reproduce many sons with descent of my Y-chromosome and let them reproduce their chromosome as much as they can. 
  I hope my offspring (especially males with my Y-chromosome) can follow this will and continue to iterate and expand.
  <!-- I want to purge all the other males with Y-chromosome and let my offsprings occupy the world.  -->
  <!-- The execution duration is about 1 million years. Hahaha. -->
</p>

<!-- <img src="/images/狗头表情.webp"> -->
<!-- So my descents (more precise than base pair level) will continue iterating to purge others' Y-chromosome (the purge sequence: R, J, E, I, Q, D, C, ..., N, O) and then occupy the world, haha! -->
