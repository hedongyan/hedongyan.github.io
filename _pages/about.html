<h1>Research Interest</h1>
<p>My research interest is causality, evaluation, multimodal.</p>
<p>Thanks for following me!</p>

<h1>Open-source Repositories</h1>
<p>
I developed an open-source repositories (https://github.com/hedongyan/awesome-causality-identification) for causal identification, welcome to contribute if you are insteresed in it.
</p>

<h1>Patent</h1>
<p>
  I own a Chinese patent "用于个性化决策系统的因果模型离线评估和学习方法及其实例" and its US patent counterpart "METHODS, SYSTEMS, AND STORAGE OF CAUSAL MODEL OFFLINE EVALUATION AND LEARNING FOR PERSONALIZED DECISION SYSTEMS". And I own a software copyright “因果效应自动识别软件”. If you are interested in them and want to have a business collaboration, please contact me.

<h1>Who am I and What I want to do</h1>
<p>I am Hedong YAN from Shandong, China. 
  My Y-chromosome is O-F46(8025 BC)/O-Z26248(2995 BC)/O-MF186197(2975 BC, about 120000 males now)/O-MF567393(1035 BC, about 3000 males in the world now), 
  which may be the paternal 600 years' cousin (common paternal node is O-Z26248, 2995 BC) of legendary Emperor Yao (O-Z26258, 2345 BC) at Shanxi 
  and may be in the tribe of legendary Emperor Shaohao (O-F23272, 2765 BC) at Shandong. 
  My mtDNA is A6, which may be the original spouse of Y-chromosome Q. 
  I have 3.79% gene of Homo neanderthalensis. Also, I have a relative higher risk of Parkinson. 
  My dream is to reproduce my chromosome as much as I can, especially the Y-chromosome. 
  So, I want to reproduce many sons with descent of my Y-chromosome and let them reproduce their chromosome as much as they can. 
  I hope my offspring, especially males with my Y-chromosome, can follow this will to iterate, spread, and overwrite the homo sapiens' Y-chromosome with my progeny Y-chromosome.
  By the way, I am good at cooking delicious Chinese food.
