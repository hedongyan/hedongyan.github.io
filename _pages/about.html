<h1>Research Interest</h1>
<p>My research interest is causality, causal learning, out-of-distribution and evaluation.</p>
<p>Thanks for following me!</p>

<h1>Patent</h1>
<p>
  I own a Chinese patent about causal evaluation. If you are interested in it and want to have a business collaboration, please contact me.
</p>

<h1>Who am I and What I want to do</h1>
<p>I am Hedong YAN from Shandong, China. My Y-chromosome is O-F46(8025 BC)/O-Z26248(2995 BC)/O-MF186197(2975 BC)/O-MF567393(1035 BC), which may be the paternal 600 years' cousin (common paternal node is O-Z26248, 2995 BC) of Yao (O-Z26258, 2345 BC) at Shanxi and may be in the tribe of Shaohao (O-F23272, 2765 BC) at Shandong. My mtDNA is A6, which may be the original spouse of Y-chromosome Q. I have 3.79% gene of Homo neanderthalensis. Also, I have a relative higher risk of Parkinson. My dream is to reproduce my gene as much as I can, especially the Y-chromosome. So, I want to reproduce many sons with descent of my Y-chromosome and let them reproduce their gene as much as they can. </p>

<!-- So my descents (more precise than base pair level) will continue iterating to purge others' Y-chromosome (the purge sequence: R, J, E, I, Q, D, C, ..., N, O) and then occupy the world, haha! -->
