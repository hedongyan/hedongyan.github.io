I am Hedong YAN from Shandong, China. My Y-chromosome is O-F46/O-Z26248/O-MF567393, which may be the brother of Yao (O-Z26258, 2375 B.C) in Shanxi and may be in the tribe of Shaohao (O-F23272, 2765 B.C). My mtDNA is A6, which is the original spouse of Y-chromosome Q. I have 3.79% gene of Homo neanderthalensis. Also, I have a relative higher risk of Parkinson. 

Thanks for following me!
